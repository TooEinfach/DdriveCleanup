DdriveCleanup


This is a script to clean up the temp files on users D drive.  The goal is this would be run with as a scheduled task and that it would cut down on calls.  We get lots of calls to clean up space on thin clients.

The powershell script is the most efficeint way to do this.  But as an organization Sandy City has shut off the ablity to run scripts.  So the Python script is a second attempt at this.
